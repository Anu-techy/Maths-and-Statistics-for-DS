Law of Large Numbers

As the sample size increases the mean of the sample gets closer to the population mean.

Law of Large number applies for Drug/Vaccination Trial, Stock Returns (long term investments show predictable consistent result)
Quality Control Manufacturing.(as the sample size increases, the accuracy of test improves)

Central Limit Theorem

For a large enough sample size (sample size >= 30), the distribution of the sample means 
(a.k.a sampling distribution) will be approximately normally distributed.
This theorem is irrespective of your original population distribution.

Example:

To build a marketing campaign for solar panels, the populationn size is 12 million families, 
sample size is 10000 families whose monthly electicity bills are surveyed.

Population - parameter
Sample - statistic

their sample size is 50, they collected 207 samples, 
Distribution of sample data is Sample Distribution

Taking means of each samples(i.e 207 samples) 
and when you plot a histogram of means it is a normal distribution.
