Inferential Vs Descriptive Statistics


**Percentiles**

To get an idea of data distribution

25th percentile --- 25% of the scores are less that 25th percentile number                             
                    
                    =PERCENTILE.INC(range, 0.25)           in Excel

50 th percentile -- median
                    
                    =PERCENTILE.INC(range, 0.5)           in Excel

99 th percentile -- 99% of the scores are less than this percentile number

**Standard Deviation**

Volatility of stock returns can be assessed using variance and standard deviation

df.nvidia_returns.std(), df.nvidia_returns.var()

df.reliance_returns.std(), df.reliance_returns.var()

**Standard Normal Distribution**

Computing z-scores for each of the datapoints and plot the distribution of z-scores

mean=0       and       std dev =1

Used in comparing data sets and in z-tests to assess differences between means
